A landing page(homepage) was added as I previously did not have one. The landing page has a logo as mentioned in my feedback as well as a button that takes you to the home screen of the app.

Homepage was created using Visily

I channged the homepage as it was said it looked  foreign so I simplified for the users by making them filter throught thr menu by courses.

This was the previous homepage

I coded 7 screens namely Homepage.js, Menuscreen.js this is the screen where the menu can be seen and filtered to prefered course, Main.js, Starter.js, Dessert.js, AddDish.js and RemoveDish.js.


In the Add and Remove screens the meals selected are stored in an array.

The AddDish screen was implemeted as per feedback and instructions

This is where the Chef is able to remove any dishes.
