A landing page(homepage) was added as I previously did not have one. The landing page has a logo as mentioned in my feedback as well as a button that takes you to the home screen of the app.

Homepage was created using Visily

I channged the homepage as it was said it looked  foreign so I simplified for the users by making they filter throught thr menu by courses.
